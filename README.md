# 32-bit RISC-V Single-Cycle Processor in Verilog

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **32-bit RISC-V (RV32I) single-cycle processor** in Verilog HDL.  
The design follows the RISC-V ISA specification and is suitable for FPGA deployment.  
It is aimed at understanding CPU architecture from scratch, starting from instruction fetch to execution.

## 🚀 Features
- Implements **RV32I Base Integer Instruction Set**
- Single-cycle datapath architecture
- Modular Verilog code for easy testing and extension
- Can be synthesized on FPGA boards like **Xilinx Artix-7** or **Altera Cyclone**
- Open-source and educational
